    <p>Make taquitos, or rolled tacos, at home with this super easy recipe that uses canned or rotisserie chicken, cheese, and hot pepper sauce. The filling is easy to adjust — add sliced jalapeños if you prefer lots of heat. Bake until crisp and serve as an appetizer or side dish with your favorite salsa. You can also serve them as a main course topped with lettuce, tomato, olives, sour cream, and more. Recipe by Sarah and tested by <abbr title="Allrecipes">
